Changes for MooseX-Role-Parameterized

1.02 September 11, 2013
    * set %INC entries in test to avoid failures with
      Moose pre-2.11 (kentfrederic)
        https://github.com/sartak/MooseX-Role-Parameterized/pull/7
        https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=88593

1.01 September 10, 2013
    * removed use of deprecated Class::MOP::load_class (ether)

1.00 January 12, 2012
    * MooseX::Role::Parameterized now depends on Moose 2.0300
      released 2011-09-23 for its several core improvements, hence the
      major version number bump.

    * MXRP now uses the new meta_lookup feature added to Moose 2.0300
      (specifically for MXRP) to avoid duplicating Moose-0.60-era
      Moose::Role sugar. This means the error messages you get are
      better, and there's a lot less ugly code in MXRP.
    * Remove alias/excludes special case errors. They have long since been
      replaced in core Moose by -alias and -excludes, and were finally
      removed in Moose 2.0200.
    * Expressly forbid using role { } inside role { } (which makes no
      sense but I suppose you could accidentally trigger it)
    * Documentation fix from cweyl@alumni.drew.edu
      https://github.com/sartak/MooseX-Role-Parameterized/pull/5

0.27  August 22, 2011
    * Remove MooseX::Role::Parameterized::Meta::Parameter; instead,
      the default for parameters of (is => 'ro') is set by the
      "parameter" sugar. This removes an unnecessary metaclass and
      removes weird edge cases caused by it. Please please please
      report any breakage!

0.26  March 20, 2011
    * make tests stop relying on a specific format for anon class/role names (doy)

0.25  March 4, 2011
    * Move the reinitialization hook from Role to Trait so hardcore hackers
      (trait janitors) get the benefit too (doy)

0.24  March 1, 2011
    * Made MXRP more extensible by hooking into the role metaobject
      reinitialization (doy)

0.23  December 25, 2010
    * Merry Christmas!
    * Make MooseX::Role::Parameterized::Extending more instructive. Hopefully.

0.22  November 26, 2010
    * The test suite now uses Test::Fatal instead of Test::Exception (Karen
      Etheridge).
    * Fix Test::More dependency (reported by Father Chrysostomos) [rt.cpan.org #63222]

0.21  November 15, 2010
    * "package" arg can now tell generate_role to use a specific package (rjbs)

0.20  November 2, 2010
    * Minor test refactoring to fix blead support [rt.perl.org #78244]

0.19  July 8, 2010
    * Documentation improvements

0.18  March 10, 2010
    * Improve the error message when you leave off the role {} block

0.16  February 4, 2010
    * Allow specifying custom metaclasses for parameterized
      roles (Oliver Charles)

    * Documentation improvements (Oliver Charles, Sartak)

0.15  January 5, 2010
    * Move the guts of MXRPMR::Parameterized into a trait. See
      http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.moose/2010/01/msg1294.html (Sartak)

0.14  December 6, 2009
    * Fix a nesting bug reported by nothingmuch with a test case provided
      by rafl (Sartak)

    * Parameterized roles now keep track of their genitor role (Sartak)

    * Delegate parameterizable->has_parameter to parameters->has_attribute
      (Sartak)

0.13  Sep 11, 2009
    * Documentation improvements (Sartak)

0.12  Aug 15, 2009
    * Add MooseX::Role::Parameterized->current_metaclass for forward compat
      (Sartak)

    * Various documentation improvements (Sartak)

0.11  Aug 9, 2009
    * Explicitly test-require Test::Moose for Fedora packaging (RSRCHBOY)

    * Finally a sensible synopsis (Sartak)

    * More examples are always good :) (Sartak)

0.10  Jun 25, 2009
    * Fix test that now warns in Moose (Sartak)

0.09  Jun 14, 2009
    * Give all modules a version number (Sartak)

0.08  Jun 14, 2009
    * Fix mis-packaging :) (Sartak)

0.07  Jun 14, 2009
    * Leave the jules nest for github (Sartak)

    * Switch to Module::Install (Sartak)

0.06  May 12, 2009
    * Fix long-standing role-role combination bug, reported by several
      users (Sartak)

    * Documentation improvements (Sartak)

0.05  Apr 24, 2009
    * Use replace_constructor in Meta::Parameter's make_immutable (nothingmuch)

    * The & prototype hack has been obviated by Moose::Exporter goodness (rafl)

    * List examples of MooseX::Role::Parameterized roles (Sartak)

0.04  Jan 30, 2009
    * The role block now receives as an argument the consuming class or role.

0.03  Jan 17, 2009
    * Parameters now default to read-only, so that you no longer have to specify
      the extremely common case of: is => 'ro'

0.02  Dec 9, 2008
    * Using keywords outside of the role block is now allowed and handled.

    * The role generated by the role block is now composed with its parent role.
      This is so you can have unparameterized components to your parameterized
      roles, and so that does_role returns true if you ask about the parent
      role (instead of the anonymous parameterized role).
