Changes for MooseX-Role-Parameterized

    * removed use of deprecated Class::MOP::load_class (ether)

1.00 January 12, 2012
    * MooseX::Role::Parameterized now depends on Moose 2.0300
      released 2011-09-23 for its several core improvements, hence the
      major version number bump.

    * MXRP now uses the new meta_lookup feature added to Moose 2.0300
      (specifically for MXRP) to avoid duplicating Moose-0.60-era
      Moose::Role sugar. This means the error messages you get are
      better, and there's a lot less ugly code in MXRP.
    * Remove alias/excludes special case errors. They have long since been
      replaced in core Moose by -alias and -excludes, and were finally
      removed in Moose 2.0200.
    * Expressly forbid using role { } inside role { } (which makes no
      sense but I suppose you could accidentally trigger it)
    * Documentation fix from cweyl@alumni.drew.edu

0.27  August 22, 2011
    * Remove MooseX::Role::Parameterized::Meta::Parameter; instead,
      the default for parameters of (is => 'ro') is set by the
      "parameter" sugar. This removes an unnecessary metaclass and
      removes weird edge cases caused by it. Please please please
      report any breakage!

0.26  March 20, 2011
    * make tests stop relying on a specific format for anon class/role names (doy)

0.25  March 4, 2011
    * Move the reinitialization hook from Role to Trait so hardcore hackers
      (trait janitors) get the benefit too (doy)

0.24  March 1, 2011
    * Made MXRP more extensible by hooking into the role metaobject
      reinitialization (doy)

0.23  December 25, 2010
    * Merry Christmas!
    * Make MooseX::Role::Parameterized::Extending more instructive. Hopefully.

    * Explicitly test-require Test::Moose for Fedora packaging (RSRCHBOY)

    * Finally a sensible synopsis (Sartak)

    * More examples are always good :) (Sartak)

0.10  Jun 25, 2009
    * Fix test that now warns in Moose (Sartak)

      users (Sartak)

    * Use replace_constructor in Meta::Parameter's make_immutable (nothingmuch)

    * The & prototype hack has been obviated by Moose::Exporter goodness (rafl)

    * List examples of MooseX::Role::Parameterized roles (Sartak)

0.04  Jan 30, 2009
    * The role block now receives as an argument the consuming class or role.

0.03  Jan 17, 2009
    * Parameters now default to read-only, so that you no longer have to specify
      the extremely common case of: is => 'ro'

0.02  Dec 9, 2008
    * Using keywords outside of the role block is now allowed and handled.

    * The role generated by the role block is now composed with its parent role.
      This is so you can have unparameterized components to your parameterized
      roles, and so that does_role returns true if you ask about the parent
      role (instead of the anonymous parameterized role).
